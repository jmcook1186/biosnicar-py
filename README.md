# BioSNICAR

<img src="./assets/example-output.jpg" width=500>


## Introduction

BioSNICAR is a set of Python scripts that predict the spectral albedo of snow and glacier ice between 200nm to 5000nm given information about the illumination conditions, ice structure and the type and concentration of light absorbing particulates (LAPs) externally mixed with the snow/ice. The jumping off point for this model was legacy FORTRAN and Matlab code of the SNICAR model developed by Flanner et al. (2007), which solves the radiative transfer equations simplified into a two-stream scheme after Toon et al. 1989. Two solvers are available: the original SNICAR matrix solver typically representing ice and snow with grains (Toon et al. 1989) and the Adding-Doubling (AD) solver representing the ice as a solid medium with air bubbles and allowing the incorporation of Fresnel reflecting layers (Brieglib and Light, 2007, Dang et al. 2019, Wicker et al. 2022). BioSNICAR couples SNICAR to a bio-optical model that allows for calculation of optical properties of snow and glacier algae to load into the model as LAPs (Cook et al. 2017, 2020). This functionality, along with the vectorized AD solver formulation, accessible user interface and applicability to a very wide range of surface conditions are the unique selling points of this implementation. This code is also very actively maintained and we welcome contributions from the community to help make BioSNICAR a useful tool for a diverse range of cryosphere scientists.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available at https://biosnicar-go-py.readthedocs.io. This README gives a brief overview of the key information required to run the model.


## How to use

There are two ways to run the BioSNICAR model: 1) use the app; 2) run the code. The app is designed to be extremely user-friendly and require no coding skills. The app simply runs in the browser and is operated with a simple graphical user interface. However, the app only has basic functionality. Power-users will prefer to run the code directly to give access to all of BioSNICAR's functions. Both cases require a Python development environment with specific packages installed. The following section describes how to set up that environment.

### Installing Environment/Dependencies

If you do not have Python installed, download Python >3.6. It is recommended to use a fresh environment using conda or venv. Once activated, install the project dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Finally, if you do not wish to install anything on your computer, but you use VSCode and Docker, then you can use the devcontainer config provided to run this code in a remote container. This requires the "remote containers" extension to be added to VSCode. Further instructions are available here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

### Using the App

Instructions for using the app are provided below.

#### Run the app

The code for the Streamlit frontend is in `~/app/streamlit/app.py`.

In a terminal, navigate to the top-level BioSNICAR directory and run:


`./start_app.sh`

This starts the Streamlit server running on `http://localhost:8501`.

### Get albedo data

Simply update the values and the spectral albedo plot and the broadband albedo value will update on the screen. You can download this data to a csv file by clicking `download data`.

### Running the code

The model driver and all the core source code can be found in `/src/biosnicar`. From the top level directory (`~/BioSNICAR_GO_PY`), run:

`python ./src/biosnicar/snicar_driver.py`

This will run the model with all the default settings. The user will see a list of output values printed to the console and a spectral albedo plot appear in a separate window. The code can also be run in an interactive session (Jupyter/iPython) in which case the relevant data and figure will appear in the interactive console.

Most users will want to experiment with changing input parameters. This is achieved by adjusting the values in the config file `inputs.yaml`. The nature of each parameter is described in in-line annotations to guide the user. Invalid combinations of values will be rejected by our error-checking code. Most users should have no reason to modify any other file in this repository except for the those in `inputs.yaml`.

More complex applications of the model code, for example model inversions, field/model comparisons etc are included under `/experiments`, with details provided in that module's own README.

We have also maintained a separate version of the BioSNICAR codebase that uses a "functional" programming style rather than the object-oriented approach taken here. We refer to this as BioSNICAR Classic and it is available in the `classic` branch of this repository. it might be useful for people already familiar with FORTRAN or Matlab implementations from previous literature. The two branches are entirely equivalent in their simulations but very different in their programming style. The object oriented approach is preferred because it is more Pythonic, more flexible and easier to debug.

#### Choosing Inputs

It is straightforward to adjust the model configuration by updating the values in `inputs.yaml`. However there is a lot of nuance to setting up the model to provide realistic simulations, and the meaning of the various parameters is not always obvious. for this reason we have put together a guide. Please refer to the documentation at https://biosnicar-go-py.readthedocs.io
