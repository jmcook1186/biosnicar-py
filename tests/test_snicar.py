"""Runs benchmarking and fuzzing tests on BioSNICAR.

To run configure these tests, update the values in conftest.py
Then navigate to the tests folder and run

`pytest`

The tests will automatically run - green dots indicate tests
passing successfully. A plot of N random spectra pairs will
be saved to the /tests folder.

The fuzzer exists to run snocar with a wide range of input variables
to check that no combinations break the code. It is quite memory intensive
to fuzz over a very large parameter space. 10^3 runs is ok on a decent
spec laptop. I have divided the fuzzer into two separate functions. One
has coverage for "config" variables that set up the radiative transfer
e.g. direct vs diffuse, approximation type, etc. The other is more for
conditions of the ice column, e.g. density, effective radius, LAPs.

To toggle the fuzzer on/off change the value of "fuzz" in conftest.py
